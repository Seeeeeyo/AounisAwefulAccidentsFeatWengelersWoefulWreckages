# Motor vehicle collisions in New York City

In June 2012, New York City's officials committed to publish online all records of future vehicle collisions occurring on the cityâ€™s roads. Their goal was to allow the public to learn more about road safety in the city which is exactly the purpose of our analysis. More than 1.3 million collisions occurred between the publication of this data set and the day we started our analysis. Therefore, in order to make sense of this tremendous amount of information we decided on two main approaches.

First of all, we looked at the spatial component of these collisions. With in mind the goal to point out locations subject to many accidents and provide insight into the problem. We, for instance, compared road safety in different neighborhoods.

Then, we focused on the temporal nature of these events. Our objective was to identify and highlight trends in the underlying data.

Finally, we also studied the causes of these accidents. Our findings and observations are all summarized in this [video](https://youtubevideourl)
